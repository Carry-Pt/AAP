Just for reference
P3 maybe is not correct, I do not want to use Ubuntu to run the code, it takes time. So, it is just some codes
P4 is almost same to P2, so I didn't do P4, maybe after several days I will update P4?? I am not sure.


All the code are not best, there will be some better algorithm to make them better.
